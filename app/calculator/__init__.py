    """
    Runs an interactive calculator REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).

    Prompts the user to enter an operation and two numbers in the format
    <operation> <a> <b>, computes the result, and prints it. Continues
    until the user types 'exit'.

    Supported operations:
        - add: Adds a and b.
        - subtract: Subtracts b from a.
        - multiply: Multiplies a and b.
        - divide: Divides a by b.

    Raises:
        ZeroDivisionError: If divide is used and b is zero (handled internally).
        ValueError: If the input format is invalid (handled internally).

    Example:
        >>> calculator()
        Enter an operation and two numbers, or 'exit' to quit: add 5 3
        Result: 8.0
